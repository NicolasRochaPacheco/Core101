# Core101
This repository is intended to host Core101 central processing unit (CPU). This CPU will be used in a System on a Chip (SoC101) that is going to be developed once the core is fully developed. This core will support a RV32IV* specification from RISC-V ISA. Further details on supported instructions will be discused later. This core is expected to be finished by May 2020.
